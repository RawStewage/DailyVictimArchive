  Thanks to everyone who mailed in their support for the return of the Daily Victim,
  especially those who foreswore bathing and procreation until the return. Although
  the one vow sorta helped the other.

For over a year the Daily Victims have had a special place in our
hearts, next to the black spot and right by the valve that's planning to
fail in about 20 years. We've shared their [Joy](%ARTICLE[79]%),
we've languished in their [sorrows](%ARTICLE[49]%). We drank [too
much caffeine](%ARTICLE[46]%), and we ate [The
Sauce](%ARTICLE[118]%).

Together we [lost our pants](%ARTICLE[104]%), [failed American
history](%ARTICLE[174]%), and suffered through [Intense
Horror](%ARTICLE[190]%) and [Satanic PC
Peripherals](%ARTICLE[277]%).

Yet always the victims were there, whether [polishing our fighting
skills](%ARTICLE[239]%) or [playing too much
Tribes](%ARTICLE[170]%). Like you, they gloated over [low
pings](%ARTICLE[186]%) and [suffered the injustice of
lag](%ARTICLE[242]%). They were also sometimes
[naked](%ARTICLE[114]%). Frequently they left you [feeling a little
dirty](%ARTICLE[94]%), but that's neither here nor there.

Together we had [A DREAM!](%ARTICLE[266]%) We were
[PIMPS](%ARTICLE[204]%) in electric pants! Sure, we wanted Quake 3
and got [puppies](%ARTICLE[82]%) instead. But that didn't stop us
from [celebrating the season](%ARTICLE[80]%).

One victim [ate an entire hot dog](%ARTICLE[222]%) during the SSX
loading screen.

We stuck together. Even when we [got the ladies
room](%ARTICLE[51]%), even when [the ladies took it
back](%ARTICLE[116]%). Like any gamer, a good Victim never gives up.

And now, despite a short recess and a change in artist, the Victims are
coming back. March 1st, by popular demand, the Daily Victim will return
to GameSpy! Who's the new artist? What perverse antics await? You'll
just have to tune in to find out. The Daily Victims are coming back! And
remember: If you're not laughing with them, it's because they're
laughing at you.
