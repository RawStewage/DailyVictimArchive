*Hi, you've reached the LOVE hotline,
where hot horny women are ready for* you*. You must be 18 or older to call...*
{: .call}

Uhhh -- hello? Hello? This is Jason -- is this not [the *WarCraft III*
tips hotline?](%ARTICLE[418]%)

*The ride of your life is only $.79 cents
a minute! For Naughty Nurses, press "1." For Barely legal teens, press
"2." For hot lesbian action, press "3." For crazy co-ed cheerleaders,
press "4."*
{: .call}

Wow, I must've dialed the wrong number. Whoa, hang on -- did you say
$.79 cents a minute? Damn! You guys are like twenty cents cheaper than
the *WarCraft III* tip line. That'll do. Uh, hook me up with some
lesbians. \*Beep\*

*You've selected ... HOT LESBIAN ACTION
... please wait while our operators rub themselves in oil and we connect
your call.*
{: .call}

I'm so glad I don't live with my parents anymore.

***Candy:** Hiiii! I'm Candy!*
{: .candy}

***Sandie:** And I'm Sandie, with an I and an E.*
{: .sandie}

***Candy:** We're your* HOT Lesbian LOVERS.
{: .candy}

Hi, I'm Jason, I'm your mealticket. How could you girls both be
lesbians, AND be my lovers? Uh, nevermind. Hey, actually I'm calling for
help with a game of *WarCraft III*. I don't suppose either of you have
ever heard of it?

***Candy:** WarCraft III! \*giggles\**
{: .candy }

***Sandie:** Jason, are you trying to say you like computer games?*
{: .sandie }

Well, actually it's a pretty stimulating hobby.

***Candy:** Sandie's just teasing you. We
love WarCraft III. We've been playing it every since we got tired of
Medal of Honor.*
{: .candy }

***Sandie:** I like* Orcs.
{: .sandie }

Whoa, slow down. You girls play WarCraft III? Both of you? At the same
time?

***Candy:** Yeah. Geez, we sit around all
day in front of a computer waiting for horny guys to call. What are we
supposed to do?*
{: .candy }

***Sandie:** Jason honey, you can only
play Windows Solitaire for so long.*
{: .sandie}

***Candy:** And let me tell you another
thing. Those Barely Legal Teens that share the other cubicle, some of
which are in their 40s? They play dirty as the undead.*
{: .candy }

***Sandie:** \*shouting\* You heard her, bitches!*
{: .sandie }

I just called a warehouse full of sex women who play WarCraft all day?
Hang on, I gotta sit down ... maybe take a pill or something ...

***Sandie:** Breathe into a bag, Jason.*
{: .sandie }

***Candy:** Aww, is little Jason having
trouble with multiplayer? You poor, poor thing. Let Sandie and I
help.*
{: .candy }

***Sandie:** Spill it, sexy man.*
{: .sandie }

I'm playing as the humans, and these Night Elves keep attacking my base
with Priestesses and Chimaeras.

***Sandie:** Ohh, they like it rough.*
{: .sandie }

***Candy:** Build me a Gryphon Aviary, Jason.*
{: .candy }

Okay, I'm building one...

***Candy:** Build it faster Jason ...
oohhh ... ohh... Faster ... FASTER!!*
{: .candy }

Oh wait, they just attacked my base with a couple Centaurs!

***Sandie:** Take it slow, Jason. I want
you to grab your knights and then right-click on the Centaurs, oh baby,
just like that. You have good hands. Now click on them!*
{: .sandie}

I'm clicking!

***Sandie:** Click harder! HARDER!!*
{: .sandie }

***Candy:** Do you have my Aviary yet, Jason?*
{: .candy }

Uh, it's coming --

***Candy:** MAKE IT COME, JASON! MAKE IT COME!*
{: .candy }

.Okay, it's making Gryphons --

***Sandie:** \*Moans\**
{: .sandie }

***Candy:** Oh yes, yes, attack the Chimaeras!*
{: .candy }

***Sandie:** Slap the Night Elf Priestess,
Jason! Slap her hard, oh! Oh yes Jason!*
{: .sandie }

Oh baby -- yeah! OH YEAH!!

***Candy:** \*Slamming hands on desk\* Oh YES! YE-EESSS!*
{: .candy }

Should I attack their base?

***Sandie:** Take it Jason! Take it! \*pants\**
{: .sandie }

I'm giving it everything I have!

***Candy:** OOHHH YEEESSSSSS.*
{: .candy }

***Sandie:** Don't stop -- oh! OHH!*
{: .sandie }

***Candy:** \*Some sort of soft gurgling noise\**
{: .candy }

Wow, that was incredible.

***Sandie:** Call us back when you're
ready to take on two opponents at once.*
{: .sandie }

Uhm, I dunno if I'm that kind of guy.

***Candy:** Wuss.*
